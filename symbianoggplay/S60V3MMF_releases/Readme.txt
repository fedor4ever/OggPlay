Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. First uninstall any version of OggPlay currently installed on your phone.
Important: Turn your phone off and on again before attempting to uninstall.
Start the application manager, scroll through the list to OggPlay and then select Remove from the Options menu.

2. Install OggPlayFonts.sis (please read the installation issues below before installing)
Important: After OggPlayFonts.sis is installed turn your phone off and on again

3. Install OggPlayS60V3_1_71aMMF.sis
Once installed you can start OggPlay and search for audio files (Select "Find new files" from the Options menu)


Installation issues
-------------------

The reason for installing the fonts package seperately is that some models of phone have problems with the uninstalling of fonts.
If at some point you do wish to uninstall the fonts you must turn your phone off and on again before attempting to do so.
In some rare cases it may be impossible to uninstall the fonts. Consequently as a precaution you may wish to consider installing the fonts
to the memory card instead of the phone memory. On the other hand, there isn't really any need to uninstall the fonts as they do
not require very much storage space and their presence on the phone should not affect any other applications.

If you add this file to your ringtone folder along with other .ogg files
