Installation issues
-------------------

The reason for installing the fonts package seperately is that some models of phone have problems with the uninstalling of fonts.
If at some point you do wish to uninstall the fonts you must turn your phone off and on again before attempting to do so.
In some rare cases it may be impossible to uninstall the fonts. Consequently as a precaution you may wish to consider installing the fonts
to the memory card instead of the phone memory. On the other hand, there isn't really any need to uninstall the fonts as they do
not require very much storage space and their presence on the phone should not affect any other applications.
