--------------------------------------------------------------
List of outstanding issues on the Series60 port of OggPlay.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to go wild. The content is more important than the style.



Issue #1 : Crashes on 44.1/stereo                               State : Committed
Crashes can happen when playing 44.1kHz stereo due to overall 
system load. (GSM call activity, MP3 started in parallel etc.)
........................
Looking at thread/proc priorities and such. Also the audio
priority should be decreased from the current 100.
............................
Now SX1 survives a GSM call, and the audio priority is set to 70.


Issue #1.1 : Nicer GSM interaction                              State : Open
GSM interaction could be more cool than it is now. The first
hint of a ringing in progress should pause OggPlay.


#Issue #1,2 : MP3 chrash                                        State : Open
When MP3 player is started in parallel with OggPlay the SX1
give up. It should be checked that it is not OggPlay that is
the only bully in this scenario.


Issue #2 : App flickers at start up                             State : Committed
App flickers at start up. (Avkon status pane)
Would it be possible to let OggPlay start in a more cool way 
regarding graphics ?
........................
I'll make a fast go for evaluation
........................
Committed a dinosaur. We'll see what the reaction is.


Issue #3 : Ejecting a MMC                                       State : Open
Ejecting a MMC hosting a playing ogg file is 
not handled gracefully.
........................
At least the SX1 can do this. Don't think there are any
MMC hotswap Nokias yet ?
........................
No Nokia with MMC hotswap available. Even the little new one,
the 6600 using Symbian 7.0s doesn't have hotswap.
........................
Perhaps hotswap on SX1 is stretching the definition a 
little, lets see what it ends up with. You can eject the 
MMC card with power on at least !



Issue #4 : Missing '.ogg' recognizer.                           State : In Work/Claus
........................
Any comments for or against ?
........................
Bert: For. User should somehow have the possibility to add the
 track to the play list.


Issue #5 : New maneuvring ??                                    State : To discussion
Maneuvring does not conform to Series60, 
volume should be navi right/left. 
........................
Any comments for or against ?
........................
Bert: Would be nice, but the left-right is used to change of control.
 We cannot use the up/down to change control, this is used in the file
 list... We could rotate the volume bar 90 degrees. That way, it would
 be more intuitive to press the up/down. Any better solutions?
.........................
Claus. Oups, Auch !-) See issue #11.


Issue#6. Skin support not working.                              State : Open
Chrashes on manual skin loading.


Issue #7. Ugly dialogs.                                         State : In work/Berthier
Dialogs are very ugly, when not absolutely unreadable. 
(The About Dialog for example)
.........................
The About window should be better now. ->Commited.
Still some work for other dialogs.


Issue #8. Error dialogs needs rework.                           State : In work/Berthier
Errors are not handled properly yet. Error msg is unreadable, 
and after dismissing the dialog, a new dialog is opened with a 
message like "Error: -101".


Issue #9. Buffer underflow handling.                            State : In work/Berthier
Nokia phones (NGage At least) have a firmwave bug: if you 
play a stream at 16000kHz, but for some reasons there is buffer 
underflow, the play rate will fall to 8000kHz. Very annoying. 
Bug was aknowledged by Nokia. The only thing we can do is buffer 
a little bit more so that buffer underflow doesn't happens too often.


Issue #10. The Options menu doesn't work at all.                State : Open


Issue #11. Right softkey Back/Exit                              State : In work / Claus
When in the 'ogg file system' back should work
as the '..' and in the 'top view' it could read Exit
and only here give app exit ?
.........................
Bert. What if we use the softkey for changing control? That way we 
   wouldn't have the problem of changing the volume using up/down ?
.............................
Claus. Brilliant ! The 'Back' RSK will read 'Next' and in the list
box the left navi key could have the same effect as '..' and 
navi-right would double the center-click functionality. Or did I
miss anything ? I'll look into making a demo..


Issue #12. Selection of (files) entry can fail                  State : Open
Start program, goto last entry (files) and press
navi center. Nothing happens which is an error.


Issue #13. Volume not preserved between sessions                State : Open
Should be saved. Or recalled ?


Issue #14. Localization (languages other than english)          State : Open
           are not supported
