--------------------------------------------------------------
List of outstanding issues on the Series60 port of OggPlay.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to go wild. The content is more important than the style.



Issue #1 : Crashes on 44.1/stereo                               State : In work/Claus
Crashes can happen when playing 44.1kHz stereo due to overall 
system load. (GSM call activity, MP3 started in parallel etc.)
........................
Looking at thread/proc priorities and such. Also the audio
priority should be decreased from the current 100.


Issue #2 : App flickers at start up                             State : In work/Claus
App flickers at start up. (Avkon status pane)
Would it be possible to let OggPlay start in a more cool way 
regarding graphics ?
........................
I'll make a fast go for evaluation


Issue #3 : Ejecting a MMC                                       State : Open
Ejecting a MMC hosting a playing ogg file is 
not handled gracefully.
........................
At least the SX1 can do this. Don't think there are any
MMC hotswap Nokias yet ?


Issue #4 : Missing '.ogg' recognizer.                           State : To discussion
........................
Any comments for or against ?


Issue #5 : New maneuvring ??                                    State : To discussion
Maneuvring does not conform to Series60, 
volume should be navi right/left. 
........................
Any comments for or against ?


Issue#6. Skin support not working.                              State : Open
Chrashes on manual skin loading.


Issue #7. Ugly dialogs.                                         State : Open
Dialogs are very ugly, when not absolutely unreadable. 
(The About Dialog for example).


Issue #8. Error dialogs needs rework.                           State : In work/Berthier
Errors are not handled properly yet. Error msg is unreadable, 
and after dismissing the dialog, a new dialog is opened with a 
message like "Error: -101".


Issue #9. Buffer underflow handling.                            State : In work/Berthier
Nokia phones (NGage At least) have a firmwave bug: if you 
play a stream at 16000kHz, but for some reasons there is buffer 
underflow, the play rate will fall to 8000kHz. Very annoying. 
Bug was aknowledged by Nokia. The only thing we can do is buffer 
a little bit more so that buffer underflow doesn't happens too often.


Issue #10. The Options menu doesn't work at all.		State : Open
