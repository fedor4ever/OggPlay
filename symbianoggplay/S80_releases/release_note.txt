OggPlay is a music player for phones running on the Symbian Operating system. 
It comes bundled with a .ogg file format decoder, but it detects and uses MMF 
plugins which may come built-in your phone or that might have been installed
later on. MP3, AAC, MP4, M4A, MID and AMR  plugins are supported.
        

History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new in Release 1.70:
--------------------------
Fixed crashes with some mp3s
Some internal changes


What's new in Release 1.6.9:
--------------------------
Added support for drive relative paths in Playlists
Selecting Shuffle Play from the menu now enables random playback
Changing between Normal Play and Shuffle Play no longer stops playback
Some internal changes (hopefully I've not broken anything)
Added alarm clock

Notes:
In order to use the alarm clock you must leave OggPlay running.
It is best to move OggPlay to the background as less processing power is used when OggPlay runs in the background.

To select a particular track for the alarm:
1. Make sure OggPlay is not currently in the middle of a track (paused)
2. Leave the track highlight on the track you want to play as the alarm

If you want a random alarm:
1. Make sure OggPlay is not currently in the middle of a track (paused)
2. Turn on "Shuffle play"
3. Leave the track highlight on "(titles)" 


What's new in Release 1.6.7:
--------------------------
Bug fixes
Added volume boost

What's new in Release 1.6.5:
--------------------------
Fixed the problems with % sign in filename: phone used to jam.
Improved the usability of volume. 

Known problems:
  + The ogg plugin provided with the oggplay package doesn't behave nicely when used 
    with the music player build-in the phone. Consider listening to ogg files only 
    with OggPlay !
  + The frequency analyzer only works with the ogg decoder plugin. For all other formats,
    the frequency analyzer is not available. 
  + The default skin is simply ugly. S60 skins can be used, if you're looking for 
    something better. If you've got a better skin, please submit it to Oggplay site, it 
    has good chances to become the default skin !
