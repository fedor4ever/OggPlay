Recognizer.S60.sis - OggPlay recognizer. Optional.
Lets the operating system launch OggPlay if a 'open file' is executed
on a .Ogg file in for instance the inbox or in a file browser application.
Note: due to a firmware bug the installation is restricted to be on MMC only.  

OggPlay has been tested on Siemens SX-1, Nokia NGage and Nokia 6600 but should
work on all Series 60 phones. Please report any problems on the sourceforge
forums found via the link above.
