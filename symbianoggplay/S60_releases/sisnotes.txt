    Welcome to OggPlay 1.0

Welcome to the Series 60
version of OggPlay, the open
source media player for Ogg
Vorbis files on Symbian,
released under the GPL by
Leif H. Wilden.

Special thanks goes to the
patient translators and to
Martin Cohen for the
artwork. And Leif :-)

We hope that you will enjoy
using OggPlay as much as we
enjoyed making it work on 
Series 60.
