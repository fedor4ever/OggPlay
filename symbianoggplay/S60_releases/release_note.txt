OggPlay is a music player for phones running on the Symbian Operating system. 
It comes bundled with a .ogg file format decoder, but it detects and uses MMF 
plugins which may come built-in your phone or that might have been installed
later on. MP3, AAC, MP4, M4A plugins are supported.

See the ReadMeFirst.html to see which file formats your phone supports.

This release will only work on Nokia 6600, Nokia 6620 and Nokia 7610.
(And any future Series60 phones that will support MMF.)
         

History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What's new in Release 1.6.2:
--------------------------
The ogg plugin can be used as a "random" ringing tone: everytime a phone call
is received, the ringing tone played will be randomly choosen from the list
of available .ogg files in the device. The file ReadMeFirst.html gives the 
instructions for creating the ramdom ringing tones.

Fixed the crackling  & popping sound (most notably on 6600, but also heard on 
some other phones as well) that was introduced in release 1.6.1.


What's new in Release 1.6.1:
--------------------------
Ogg files can now be reliably used as ringing tone. 
Support for bluetooth headset.

This adress a feature of previous versions where ogg files could be set as ringing tone,
but they were simply not ringing when call was received. This has been fixed. And as expected,
when using ogg as ringing tone, vibration will work, if enabled. 
Proper functionality of ringing tones has been verified on 2 different firmware versions of 6600, 
and on one 7610.


What's new in Release 1.6.0:
--------------------------
Support for MP4 format.
Support for M4A format, aka, the iTunes(TM) format. This format is exactly same as mp4, 
but in order to use it, you´ll have to rename the file extension from m4a to mp4.

Capability to choose which plugin will be used. Note that the plugin that you choose might
not be fully compatible with OggPlay (OvController, for example).

A little bunch of bug fixes.

What's new in Release 1.5.1:
--------------------------
Some bug fixes related to MP3 and AAC reading on the Nokia 7610:
 + Forward/Rewind now functional
 + Volume not going back to maximum level, when changing tune.

Ogg files can now be played using "Nokia Music Player", in the very
unlikely event that OggPlay UI is not preferred.

What's new in Release 1.5.0:
--------------------------

OggPlay nows plays MP3 and AAC in addition to Ogg file format, depending
on the phone capabilities.


What's missing:
---------------
Some features present in 1.0.0 have been dropped, since quite a lot of work is required to
make them work in a MMF plugin. They will be reintroduced in future releases.
These features are:
  - Amplification (6, 12 db)
  - Frequency analyzer
