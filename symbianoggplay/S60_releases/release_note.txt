About OggVorbis:
----------------
Ogg Vorbis is an audio compression format similar to mp3.However the
compressed files are approximately a factor two smaller than mp3 files.
To be more precise an ogg file encoded with 64kbit/sec gives approximately the
same level of audio quality as a 128kbit/sec mp3 file. In addition the ogg 
format is a free format, i.e. nobody pays licence fees when recording or 
playing music in this format. Free converters for the ogg vorbis format are 
available widely for all platforms. More information and some sample files 
here: http://www.vorbis.com/.
