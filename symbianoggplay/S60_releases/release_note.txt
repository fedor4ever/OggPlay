OggPlay is a music player for phones running on the Symbian Operating system. 
It was originally playing only .ogg file format, but some of the latest versions 
now plays MP3 and AAC in addition to OGG files

See the ReadMeFirst.html to see which file formats your phone supports.

This release will only work on Nokia 6600, Nokia 6620 and Nokia 7610.
(And any future Series60 phones that will support MMF.)

The Symbian MMF Ogg Plugin example "OvController" conflicts with this SW.
If you have installed the example, please remove it before using this release.             

History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new in Release 1.5.1:
--------------------------
Some bug fixes related to MP3 and AAC reading on the Nokia 7610:
 + Forward/Rewind now functional
 + Volume not going back to maximum level, when changing tune.

Ogg files can now be played using "Nokia Music Player", in the very
unlikely event that OggPlay UI is not preferred.

What's new in Release 1.5.0:
--------------------------

OggPlay nows plays MP3 and AAC in addition to Ogg file format, depending
on the phone capabilities.


What's missing:
---------------
Some features present in 1.0.0 have been dropped, since quite a lot of work is required to
make them work in a MMF plugin. They will be reintroduced in future releases.
These features are:
  - Amplification (6, 12 db)
  - Frequency analyzer
