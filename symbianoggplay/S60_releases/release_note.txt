What's new in Release 1.093:
--------------------------

Internal changes only
(Some minor bug fixes)


What's new in Release 1.092:
--------------------------

Added support for drive relative paths in Playlists
Selecting Shuffle Play from the menu now enables random playback
Changing between Normal Play and Shuffle Play no longer stops playback
Some internal changes (hopefully I've not broken anything)


What's new in Release 1.091:
--------------------------
Added alarm clock
Some internal changes / one very minor bug fix

Notes:
In order to use the alarm clock you must leave OggPlay running.
It is best to move OggPlay to the background as less processing power is used when OggPlay runs in the background.

To select a particular track for the alarm:
1. Make sure OggPlay is not currently in the middle of a track (paused)
2. Leave the track highlight on the track you want to play as the alarm

If you want a random alarm:
1. Make sure OggPlay is not currently in the middle of a track (paused)
2. Turn on "Shuffle play"
3. Leave the track highlight on "(titles)" 


What's new in Release 1.0.9b:
--------------------------
Bug fixes:
1. Support 8KHz mono playback (this should also allow streaming over bluetooth)
2. Fix audio skips and "slow motion" on NGage
3. Fix pause / play not updating position
4. Frequency analyzer now works for all supported oggs (8KHz-48KHz, mono/stereo)
5. Support stereo down sampling (e.g 48KHz stereo -> 44.1KHz stereo)
6. Fix "Not so random" random playback


What's new in Release 1.0.9a:
--------------------------
Fixed start from shortcut crash


What's new in Release 1.0.9:
--------------------------

Some bug fixes


What's new in Release 1.0.8:
--------------------------
Experimental new playback engine (see Options->Playback)
3 buffering modes:
No buffering - best for multi-tasking but unresponsive OggPlay UI
Single thread - Fewer audio dropouts but still unresponsive OggPlay UI (needs an extra 256K free memory)
Multi thread - Fewest number of audio dropouts, responsive OggPlay UI (needs an extra 1MB free memory)
