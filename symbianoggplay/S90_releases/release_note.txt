What's new in Release 1.72:
---------------------------

Added mp3 decoder (MAD). This is disabled by default (To enable it go to the codecs page and select mp3->Internal).
Added repeat modes (Repeat song, Repeat playlist)
New playback engine for oggs, ogas and flacs (optional for mp3s)
Some internal changes and improvements

Note that installing OggPlay no longer allows oggs and flacs to be played by the
built-in music player or used as ringtones. In order to add this functionality the MMF plugin must be installed. If any S90 users require the MMF plugin please let me know by posting a message to the OggPlay forums.
